This Accelerator is to quickly identify which tracking algorithm might work better than others in variety of use cases.
Idea is to use this repo as quick start to understand the effectivemes of various algorithms available in open-cv.
Some of those main algorithms are:

1.Boosting 
2.MIL 
3.KCF 
4.GOTURN

* Input a video of your choice containing an object which you want to track and check which available option suits best.
